This repository contains the code for reproducing the work "Melanoma recognition by fusing convolutional blocks and Dynamic Routing between Capsules". We used as base model the implementation provided by Xifeng Guo ([https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras](https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras)).
